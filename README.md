Some basic setup include:
1) Install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) Clone your repo using git clone "GITHUB URL" into your IDE (Works for both cs50 ide and VSCode on my end, happy to be suggested otherwise)
3) Run `npm install` to install all dependencies needed from node.js
4) Run `npm run start` to start the Vue test app or `npm run lint` for linting
