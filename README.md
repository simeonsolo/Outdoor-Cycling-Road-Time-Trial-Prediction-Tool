# CYCOUT10

This is a basic expressJS + VueJS + node.js application with some OAuth security measures in place, a better reference on the implementation of it can be found at https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-make-secure-http-requests-with-vue-and-express/

Some basic setup include:
1) Install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) Clone your repo using `git clone [GITHUB URL]` into your IDE (Works for both cs50 ide and VSCode on my end, happy to be suggested otherwise)
3) Run `npm install` to install all dependencies needed from node.js
4) Run `npm run start` to start the Vue test app or `npm run lint` for linting
